Python Currency Converter
This is a simple and modern currency converter application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to convert amounts between various currencies, view a limited history of recent conversions, and switch between light and dark themes.

Features:
Real-time Conversion (Simulated): Converts amounts based on a predefined set of exchange rates. (Can be extended to fetch live rates from an API).

Limited Conversion History: Displays the last 3 conversions directly on the main interface.

Dynamic Theming: Toggle between a clean light theme (inspired by Windows Calculator) and a sleek dark theme.

Intuitive UI: User-friendly interface with input fields, dropdowns for currency selection, and clear result display.

Swap Currencies: Easily switch the "From" and "To" currencies with a single button.

Clear Functionality: Reset inputs and clear the conversion history.

Fixed Aspect Ratio: The application window maintains its proportions when resized or maximized, ensuring a consistent look.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library.

tkinter.ttk: Themed Tkinter widgets for a more modern look (e.g., Combobox for dropdowns).

How to Run:
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations. If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError related to tkinter, you might need to install it:

On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

On Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

On macOS: Tkinter should be part of the Python installation from python.org.

Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/AnshGajera/currency_converter.git
cd currency_converter

Run the Application:
Execute the Python script:

python currency_converter.py

(Depending on your Python setup, you might need to use python3 currency_converter.py instead.)

Usage:
Enter the amount you wish to convert in the "Amount:" field.

Select the source currency from the "From:" dropdown.

Select the target currency from the "To:" dropdown.

Click the "Convert" button to see the result.

The recent conversions will appear at the top of the window.

Future Enhancements:
Integrate with a real-time exchange rate API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, FreeCurrencyAPI) to get up-to-date rates.

Add more currencies to the EXCHANGE_RATES dictionary.

Implement input validation to ensure only numbers are entered in the amount field.

Add a feature to copy the result to the clipboard.
